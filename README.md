# Gift-Share

Gift Share is a full stack application that makes gift giving easier.

Users have their own dashboard where they can create, edit delete and mark gifts completed. 
The dashboard also offers two friends features. First, they are able to see a list of friends where they can unfriend or view their frieends profiles. 
Second, they are able to see their friends who have birthdays within 30 days of the present day. They can go to their friends profile to see gift ideas or send a card 
via the link to postable.com.

The user can also add friends via their friends profiles or the explore page that lists all users registered in the app. There are privacy permissions that will not 
allow users freely see non-friend profiles unless they add the user.

Gift Share is built in React.js and styled with react bootstrap libraries for React.  I built the APIs using C#/.Net and T-SQL.

# Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

npm start Runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build Builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

npm run eject Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
